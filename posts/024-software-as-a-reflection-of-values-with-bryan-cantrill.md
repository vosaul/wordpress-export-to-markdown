title: "Software as a Reflection of Values With Bryan Cantrill"

Which operating system is the best? Which programming language is the best? What text editor?

Bryan Cantrill, CTO of Joyent says that is the wrong question. Languages, operating systems and communities have to make trade offs and they do that based on their values. So the right language is the one who's values align with you and your projects goals.

This simple idea carries a lot of weight and I think has the potential to lift up technical discussions to a higher level of discourse. You will find it to be a helpful frame next time you need to make a technical decision. Bryan is also pretty excited about how the values of the rust community align with his values for system software.

Also we cover Oberon, Clean and Simula, none of which I've never heard of and how IBM System/370 's Global Trace Facility doesn't hold a candle to DTrace.
