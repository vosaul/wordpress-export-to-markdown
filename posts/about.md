#### A Message from the host:

![](images/profile_2-e1537043637969.jpg) **_In software development, there are so many smart and interesting people creating new things. I interview them and you can learn about a topic as I do. Whether the specific topic is graphQL or dependent types and whether the topic is familiar to you, or something you have never encountered, I think you will learn a couple of things and enjoy the process. I hope you subscribe and enjoy,_**
