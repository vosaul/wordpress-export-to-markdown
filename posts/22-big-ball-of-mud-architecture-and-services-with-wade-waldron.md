In 1997, researchers analyzed the actual architectures of software in the field. The horrifying results: a large portion were best described by colorful phrases like "big ball of mud" and "sweep it under the rug."

Wade Waldron talks about designing reactive applications and systems and how to avoid these anti-patterns. We also cover when a monolith is the right choice, hexagonal architecture, what to do if you're stuck with a big ball of mud and more.
