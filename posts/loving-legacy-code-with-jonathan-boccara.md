Legacy code is everywhere. I don't think I've met anyone who doesn't have to deal with legacy code in the substantial portion of his work.

Our guest, Jonathan Boccara is a French C++ developer and the author of The Legacy Code Programmer's Toolbox. In this episode, Jonathan will help us understand and build the correct mindset to effectively work with legacy code by using his approach and processes.

"An important message I'm trying to get across is that you should not complain if you don't, in turn, intend to improve the code."

"That would be any critique that's technical. One thing that comes up very often is levels of abstraction. If I had to sum up best practices in, in three words, that would be those levels of abstraction."

"The point of code is to make a piece of software run and to make it run in a way that will make customers happy. "
