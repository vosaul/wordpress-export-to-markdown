title: "Micro Service Architectures With Jan Machacek"

I don't know a lot about micro services.  Like how to design them and what the various caveats and anti-patterns are.  I'm currently working on a project that involves decomposing a monolithic application into separate parts, integrated together using Kafka and http.

Today I talk to coauthor of upcoming book, Reactive Systems Architecture : Designing and Implementing an Entire Distributed System.  If you want to learn some of the hows and whys of building a distributed system, I think you'll really enjoy this interview.  The insights from this conversation are already helping me.
