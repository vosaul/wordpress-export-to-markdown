#### **Does god code in Haskell?**

Professor and accomplished programming language researcher Philip Wadler believes that typed lambda calculus was discovered not invented -- part of the underpinnings of the universe itself. As a result, functional programming languages are more fundamental and deeply justified than their alternatives.

We talk about this principle, which has guided his career. Phil takes us through the history of computer science from Turing to Alonzo Church. Eventually we get to what the movie Independence Day got wrong and what language a theoretical creator deity would program in.
