Today I talk to Vaughn Vernon about how Domain Driven Design can help with designing micro services.  The guidelines that Vaughn has developed in his work on DDD can provide guidance for where service and consistency boundaries should be drawn.  We also talk about the platform he is developing for applying these DDD concepts using the actor model, [Vlingo](https://vlingo.io).

Also my group at [Tenable](https://tenable.com/) is hiring for our web app scanning product.  We are looking for a talented developer and I think it is really a great place to work.  Security, Scaling, and Performance are some of the challenges that make this an interesting position where a great developer with functional programming skills could really excel.  [Apply here](http://app.jobvite.com/m?3cBP1kws) and or hit me up on twitter or email ( adam@corecursive.com ) for further details.
