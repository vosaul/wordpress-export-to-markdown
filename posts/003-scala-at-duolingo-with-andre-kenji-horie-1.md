“So I was actually more fascinated that Scala is like a modern language. It has so many nice things that we don't have in Python and Java that kind of outweighs the pain points. “ - Andre Kenji Horie 

“I mean, it's that sort of thing that after working with a Python a lot of time you just become so used to that, that whenever you have something nice, you're like, “Oh, that's nice.” - Andre Kenji Horie 

“There are caveats, it's slower to write a piece of code, but then the amount of effort you have to maintain that code in your test code is a lot lower in Scala, so for me, in the long run, Scala is just a faster language than Python.” - Andre Kenji Horie
