Adam talked to Jared Forsyth about his journey from untyped javascript to using flow and eventually reasonml.

"I mean, I was, I'll admit it I was definitely in the: 'I was scarred by Java and C plus plus in an intro to programming class and I never want to look at types again' Camp"

"My first language was Python and followed closely by Javascript. And so I was, I was loving the loosey-goosey scripting language.

My first experience of using types in JavaScript, I was like is this going to be terrible? Because there's so much overhead in Java and C plus, plus you have to write types for literally everything." [Podcast Transcript](https://corecursive.com/the-reason-for-types-in-javascript/)
