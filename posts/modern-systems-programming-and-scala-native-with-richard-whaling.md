title: "Modern Systems Programming And Scala Native With Richard Whaling"

Richard Whaling has an interesting perspective on software development. If you write software for the JVM or if you are interested in low level system programming, or even doing data heavy or network heavy IO programming then you will find this interview interesting.

We discuss how to build faster software in a modern fashion by using glibc and techniques from system programming. This means using raw pointers and manual memory management but from a modern language.

Richard also shares some perspectives on better utilizing the underlying operating system and how we can build better software by depending on services rather than libraries.
