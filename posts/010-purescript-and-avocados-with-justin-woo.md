Purescript is a functional programming language that compiles to javascript.  It is a strict haskell dialect that can run anywhere that javascript does.

Justin Woo is a self described Purescript evangelist and enthusiast. We talk about purescript vs elm and working with expressive type systems.  Justin also had some great metaphors about phantom types and masking tape as well as avacados and testing.
