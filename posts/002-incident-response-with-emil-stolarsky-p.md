#### Preparedness and Enabling Accurate and Quick Incident Responses

As a system becomes more complex, the chance of failure increases. At a large enough scale, failures are inevitable. Incident response is the practice of preparing for and effectively recovering from these failures.

In this interview Emil argues that we need to move beyond tribal knowledge and incorporate practices such as an incident command system and rigorous use of checklists. Emil suggests that we need to move beyond a mindset of “move fast and break things” and toward a place of more deliberate preparation.

“The only way we can fight those biases and do an effective analysis of what went wrong is by having other people point them out.” - Emil Stolarsky

“Because postmortems retrospectives are super valuable. You don't want to repeat the same mistake.” - Emil Stolarsky
