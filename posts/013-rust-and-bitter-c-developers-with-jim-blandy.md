Today I talk with Jim Blandy, one of the authors of Programming Rust.  We talk about what problems rust is trying to solve, the unique language features and type system of rust. It includes both algebraic data types, type classes, and generics.  We also touch on why it is so hard to secure code. Jim works on Firefox and his insights into the difficulty of writing secure code are super interesting.
